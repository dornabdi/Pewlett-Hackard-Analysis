# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The goal with this project is to prepare Pewlett-Hackard with projections regarding their retirement and mentorship programs. In the first deliverable, I used SQL to determine the number of retiring employees per job title. Then, I used the same language to identify all of the employees elibigle to participate in a mentorship program. 

## Results

### Deliverable 1: Eligible Retirees

- Most of the retiring roles are that in senior level positions. 29,414 Senior Engineers and 28,254 Senior Staff are retiring, this means that Pewlett-Hackard needs to consider a hiring strategy that will not feel unnatural to junior and entry level employees. 

- Many engineers are retiring. 29,414 Senior Engineers, 14,222 Engineers, and 1,761 Assistant Engineers are retiring this year. This brings the total retiring engineer count to 45,397. Refer to an image of the count of retiring job titles below:

## Summary 
-How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

-Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
